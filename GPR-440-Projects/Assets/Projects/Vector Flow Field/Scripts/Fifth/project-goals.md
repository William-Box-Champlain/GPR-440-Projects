# Mipmap Pathfinding Project: Goals & Objectives

## Project Overview

Develop a high-performance GPU-based pathfinding system using a mipmap hierarchical approach to efficiently generate vector fields for multiple dynamic targets. The system will support a large 12,000 Ã— 6,000 navigation space with network-style paths, handling up to 1000 agents navigating to 3-5 dynamic targets that activate in an outside-in sequence.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Performance Optimization

- **Target Frame Rate**: Maintain steady 60 FPS with minimal impact from pathfinding
- **Agent Scalability**: Support up to 1000 simultaneous agents
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize GPU and CPU memory usage through multi-resolution approach
- **Update Distribution**: Spread computation across multiple frames for consistent performance

### 2. Implementation Simplicity

- **Leverage GPU Hardware**: Utilize built-in mipmap and texture filtering capabilities
- **Simplified Architecture**: Balance computational efficiency with manageable code complexity
- **Unity Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Unity systems
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Clear component separation with well-defined interfaces

### 3. Navigation Quality

- **Path-Aware Processing**: Focus computational resources on actual navigation paths
- **Junction Handling**: Preserve accurate navigation at ~50 path junctions
- **Target Adaptability**: Support outside-in target activation sequence
- **Dynamic Response**: Handle large barrier-type dynamic obstacles

## Technical Approach

### Short-Term Implementation

1. **Mipmap Hierarchy**:
   - Generate 4-5 resolution levels from base navigation texture
   - Use built-in GPU mipmap capabilities where possible
   - Conservative downsampling to preserve path connectivity

2. **Resolution Bias**:
   - Automatic junction detection and bias application
   - Target-based resolution prioritization
   - Gradual blending between resolution levels

3. **Vector Field Generation**:
   - Low-to-high resolution processing for quick initial results
   - Multi-stage light propagation algorithm
   - Interpolation between resolution levels for smooth transitions

4. **Basic Agent Integration**:
   - Simple position-based direction queries
   - Individual agent lookup implementation
   - Direct integration with existing AI controllers

### Future Extensions

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Optimized batch queries for multiple agents
   - Job system integration for parallel processing
   - Memory-coherent access patterns

2. **Advanced Bias Controls**:
   - Dynamic bias based on agent density
   - Gameplay-driven importance factors
   - Performance-based automatic LOD adjustment

3. **Optimization Refinements**:
   - Custom mipmap generation for better path preservation
   - Sparse processing for mostly empty regions
   - Memory pooling and compression techniques
